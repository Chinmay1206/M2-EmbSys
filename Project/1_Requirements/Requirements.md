   * DIODE AND LED
      * A Diode is the simplest two-terminal unilateral semiconductor device. It allows current to flow only in one direction and blocks the current that flows in the opposite         direction. The two terminals of the diode are called as anode and cathode. The characteristics of a diode closely match to that of a switch. An ideal switch when open does not     conduct current in either directions and in closed state conducts in both directions. Ideally, in one direction that is indicated by the arrow head diode must behave short         circuited and in other one that opposite to that of the direction of arrow head must be open circuited. By ideal characteristics, the diodes is designed to meet these features     theoretically but are not achieved practically. So the practical diode characteristics are only close to that of the desired
     
   * BUZZER
      * An audio signaling device like a beeper or buzzer may be electromechanical or piezoelectric or mechanical type. The main function of this is to convert the signal from         audio to sound. Generally, it is powered through DC voltage and used in timers, alarm devices, printers, alarms, computers, etc. Based on the various designs, it can generate     different sounds like alarm, music, bell & siren.
   
   * RESISTOR
      * A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. Resistors act to reduce current flow, and, at the         same time, act to lower voltage levels within circuits. Resistors may have fixed resistances or variable resistances, such as those found in thermistors, trimers, photo           resistors and potentiometers. The current through a resistor is in direct proportion to the voltage across the resistor's terminals. This relationship is represented by Ohm's     law in I is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, V is the potential difference measured across the conductor in units of volts, and R is the resistance of       the conductor in units of ohms (symbol: Ω). 
      * Fixed value resistor:
        Fixed value resistors are those types of resistors whose value is fixed already while manufacturing and cannot be changed during its usage

   * RELAY
      * Relays are most commonly used switching device in electronics. There are two important parameters of relay, first is the Trigger Voltage, this is the voltage required to       turn on the relay that is to change the contact from Common → NC to Common → NO. The other parameter is your Load Voltage & Current, this is the amount of voltage or current       that the NC, NO or Common terminal of the relay could withstand, in our case for DC it is maximum of 30V and 10A. Make sure the load you are using falls into this range
