* The water level is full – Nothing happens
* Water level drops to the reference probe – Alarm is triggered
* Fill start is triggered automatically turning on the water to fill the tank
* Once the water is full, fill stop is triggered and the system automatically stops the pump
* The system resets and waits for water levels to drop again

| Case 1 | If the overhead tank is filled &                   | As there is water in the overhead tank no need of MOTORing the water is required,                    |
|        |  underground tank is filled then the MOTOR is off  | hence conservation of energy and prevention of wastage of water.                                     |
| Case 2 | If the overhead tank is empty &                    | As there is no water in the tank as well as underground tank has wate                                | 
|        |  underground tank is filled then the MOTOR is on.  | hence MOTORing of water is required which is achieved by switching the MOTOR on.                     |
| Case 3 | If the overhead tank is empty &                    | Though there is no water in the overhead MOTOR so starting the MOTOR on is a necessity but absence of|
|        | underground tank is empty then the MOTOR is off    | water in the underground tank as indicated by the sensor helps the system to switch off the MOTOR.   | 
| Case 4 | If the overhead tank is Filled &                   | Since there is no requirement of water in the overhead tank the MOTOR is off.                        |
|        | underground tank is empty then the MOTOR is off    |                                                                                                      |
