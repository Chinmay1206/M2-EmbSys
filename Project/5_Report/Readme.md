   # ABSTRACT

Water Monitoring System is an IoT based Liquid Level Monitoring system that has the mechanism to keep the user alerted in case of liquid overflow or when tank depletes. The water tanks can be fixed with ultrasonic sensors that is placed over the container. Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure, compare container depth and liquid level.

The status of the system could be monitored by a LCD screen or a web page that provides a brilliant graphical representation. Colours are used to depict various scenarios with respect to the amount of liquid in the tanks or containers and the buzzer buzzes when the limit exceeds the permissible quantity of fill.

 # JUSTIFICATION:
 
 Automatic water level monitor came into existence because of human error and inconsistence that is associated with manually operated waterpumping machine. This is because it takes time for individual who is manually operating the water pump to turn off the pumping machine and this may cause water spillage and at times the individual might not know that the water level has drop so low until the tank is completely empty.This was the problem that leads to the development of the ideal of anautomatic water level control and automatic pump short down.
 
#  CONSTRAINS:

 The biggest setback experience during the course of this project is difficulties in finding the design of the project,
 secondly sourcing of material and component I used for the project.

# Advantages:
  * Easy installation. 
  * Low maintenance. 
  * Compact and elegant design.
  * Users can control the required level of water in over head tank. 
  * Avoids wastage of water from tanks. ï‚· It can maintain exact preset water levels. 
  * The  system  is  very  versatile,  a  numbers  of  tailor  made  variations  like  control  of multiple tanks or multiple pumps are possible. 
  * Being automatic saves man power.

# Applications:
  
  * Used in buildings where the manual monitoring is difficult. 
  * Used in industries to control the water level and in chemical mixing etc. 
  * It can be installed in metro cities where the drinking water is the only water used for all purposes which keeps the drinking water from being wasted.

# Goals of this project :
  * _To reduce the wastage of water across the city_
  * _To provide better water supply to the people_
